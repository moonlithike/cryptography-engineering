### resources
* cryptography engineering, chapter 1 & 2


### exercises
Ch 1:
- Q10. Describe a concrete example where improving the security of a system against one type of attack can increase the likelihood of other attacks.

Ch 2:
- Q3. Consider a group of 30 people who wish to establish pair-wise secure communications using symmetric-key cryptography. How many keys need to be exchanged in total.
- Q4. Suppose Bob receives a message signed using a digital signature scheme with Alice's secret signing key. Does it prove that Alice saw the message and chose to sign.
- Q6. Suppose a chosen-ciphertext attacker cannot recover the secret decryption key for an encryption scheme. Does this mean the encryption scheme is secure?
- Q7. Consider a symmetric-key cryptosystem in which cryptographic keys are randomly selected from the set of all n-bit strings. Approximately what should n be in order to provide 128 bits of security against a birthday attack.

General:
- Find two libraries for each of RSA, TLS/SSL, and AEAD. Evaluate the maturity each library, and skim the code. What about the library structure makes sense? How is their documentation? These links may help:
    - https://cryptography.rs/
    - https://lib.rs/ (librs is equivalent to crates.io, with a different interface)
- Benchmark the speed of an algorithm in the two different implementations with [Criterion](https://lib.rs/crates/criterion).
    - User guide: https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html
    - Video intro: https://youtu.be/eIB3Pd5LBkc
- Implement the [Vign√®re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) in 100 lines or less.
- What is a side channel attack? Is your cipher implementation constant time?
