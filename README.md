# cryptography-engineering

this repository will track my cryptography engineering self study. 
i hope my work here will help others on the same path.

my background is that i'm a senior backend engineer and my goal is to become an 
effective engineer in one of the emerging cryptography fields like ZKPs, MPC or FHE.

## resources

i break down the areas of study into three general categories: rust, cryptography engineering, cryptography mathematics

### rust
TODO

### cryptography engineering
these resources have helped me understand cryptography primitives and 
cryptosystems in practical terms. they cover the same material but in different ways.

* cryptography engineering: schneier
* real world cryptography: wong
* crypto101: lvh
* coursera crypto and a graduate course in applied cryptography: dan boneh
* cryptopals exercises
* cryptohack

### cryptography mathematics
these resources have been helpful in understanding the mathematical terrain of the 
primitives discussed above.
* handbook of applied cryptography
* an introduction to mathematical cryptography
